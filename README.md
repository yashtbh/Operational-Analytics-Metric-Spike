## 📁 Case Studies

### ✅ Case Study 1: **Job Data Analysis**
**Objective:** Assess reviewer throughput and operational efficiency.

- Analyzed job review data over time.
- Identified peak reviewer activity (e.g., 11/28/2020).
- Used 7-day rolling averages for smooth trend visualization.
- Detected duplicate entries indicating data quality issues.
- Performed language share analysis to optimize reviewer allocation.

### ✅ Case Study 2: **Metric Spike Investigation**
**Objective:** Uncover patterns in user engagement, growth, and retention.

- Spotted user engagement spikes (notably on 2014-07-27).
- Tracked user growth peaks (e.g., 2014-08 saw 1,031 new users).
- Conducted retention analysis revealing drop-offs after week 1.
- Analyzed engagement by device (MacBook Pro was the top device).
- Studied email engagement actions (clickthroughs, opens, digests).
